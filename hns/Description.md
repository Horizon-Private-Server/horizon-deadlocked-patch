# Description
Players load into a game of hide and seek. The seekers are randomly selected and frozen in place. A countdown to unfreeze begins for the seekers while the hiders are on the run. Can the hiders survive before the game ends?

# Fixed settings
* 1-6 players = 1 seeker selected.
* 7+ players = 2 seekers selected.
* Radars blips, healthcrates, vehicles, special pickups and quick chat are always off.
* Game time is set to 10 minutes, unless manually set on the create game menu.

# Toggles
* Freeze Hiders (On/Off). This will allow for a host to decide if hiders should be frozen in place after the seeker countdown ends or if hiders have the ability to freely roam during the game.
* Seeker Freeze Time (30-120 seconds). This will allow for a host to set the allotted time that seekers will be frozen in place for at the start of a game. It will range from 30-120 seconds and can be incremented by 30 seconds (30, 60, 90, 120).
* Seeker Perks (On/Off). If enabled, seekers will be given four special perks to use at the halfway mark of a game for a one-time use. The first perk turns radar blips on for the seeker for 5 seconds. The second perk turns off level rendering for the entire level for 5 seconds allowing the seeker to temporarily peer through walls. The third perk halves the health of every hider that is still alive. The fourth perk freezes hiders in place for 5 seconds. These can be chosen with the directional buttons.

# Hiders
* Hiders are on the blue team by default.
* Survival is on for hiders, so if hiders die, they stay down for the rest of the game. They can of course still spectate other players when dead.
* If a hider dies before the seeker freeze countdown ends, they are force respawned.
* Hiders win the game by surviving until the end.

# Seekers
* Seekers are selected after a game loads.
* Seekers are changed to the red team.
* Seekers are frozen in place after being selected for the allotted amount of time set by the host.
* Seekers have infinite health.
* Seekers can respawn if they die.
* Spectate mode is disabled for seekers.
* If players volunteer to be seekers in the game lobby, they can change to the red team to be automatically selected for the seeking role.
* Seekers win the game by killing all hiders before time runs out.
